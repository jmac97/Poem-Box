# Poem Box

This project was created for the Poetry Club at Stevens Institute of Technology.
Pressing the button at the top of the box prints out 1 of 19 stored short poems.

poem.ino was the code that was used for this project. parm.ino was based on this code and was created for a gift. Instead of poems, it prints a pauris from the Japji Sahib.
